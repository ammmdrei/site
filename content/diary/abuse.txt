never realized until recent years that i was physically abused everyday by a school colleague at 13-14 years old


idk why but it makes much more sense now to why im so socially incompetent

before that happened i wasnt so timid.


she used to hit me, grab my hair, destroy my school work and just be horrible towards me

i think i even bled once


i dont think i was stupid for allowing it to happen, i was probably afraid
the worst part is, i thought she was being affective




bitch
