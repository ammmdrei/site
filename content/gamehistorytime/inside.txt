you have to maintain an underground bunker
the outside world is dark, empty and unapologetic





the player is living in a bunker and has to do basic chores to do

like:

- maintain the aquarium, as it provides oxygen in the bunker
- check for radio signals sent by, hopefully, other humans
- fix the ground level antenna







mechanical ideas:

- Game uses users computer real time in game
- Game creates files in the players computer:
{
  somewhere in the game, the player will be lured to use a command in the games computer, that
  "connects" with the real players computer, sending data.

  or maybe you'll be the one to send data to the players computer, idk
}
